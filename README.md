### Naive Bayes Algorithm Implementation in R

##### Instructions

run('file.csv',m,iterations)

where file.csv is the path to the data file with target labelled "class". m is the weight given to prior. iterations is the number of times you want to run Naive Bayes to get an average prediction accuracy.

Note: this is a binary classifier implementation
